# Find-Your-Way-Travelling-nodes
Welcome to this Node.js repository! We built this application because we were fascinated by pathfinding algorithms, and wanted to visualize them in action. 
The APIs we use, make work easy and fast but I believe we should remain grounded and have expertise in the building blocks of DSA. 
This project has algorithms for finding path between the start and target nodes, You can set walls (obstacles), bombs(Yes bombs!), make mazes while you visualize the algorithm of your choice

To Run This Project type:

```
npm i

npm start
```

The server will be up and running on
```
localhost:1337/
